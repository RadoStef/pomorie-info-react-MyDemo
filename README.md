## Pomorie-info **React** version

---

> At this point this project is still in the development phase and it is not LIVE. This is the first React project code that I am sharing on my GitHub.
> .jpg pictures are NOT uploaded to GitHub, so if you want to download and start the project it would not work.

<ul>
  <li>❗👉 Please, note that the development is still in progress. I need to fix some issues related to the site responsiveness(most on the main page)</li>
  <li>❗👉 Also, be informed that some of these pages are made **only for demo purposes** and would not exist in the real project (table page, post data to Firebase, subscribe form in the footer, and some other)</li>
  <li>❓ What I have been using?</li>
  <li>❗ Styling:  CSS, module.css, JSS (js in css to apply styles on some MUI components), sx prop for MUI inline styling</li>
  <li>❗ Custom card elements (props.children), props, useState, useEffect, React Router, React hooks form, and YUP</li>
  <li>❗ Third-party libraries like: Axios, Moment, React-pdf, Fslightbox-react, Material UI</li>
</ul>
My idea is to rework the pomorie-info vanilla JS project into React project, and also show some of my developing skills and knowledge.
I hope there will be time for this and the project will be ready before the end of the summer season 2023.

✔🎯 wish me luck! :)
