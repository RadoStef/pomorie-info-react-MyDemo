# Getting started with Pomorie-info **React** version
****
> At this point this project is still in the development phase and it is not LIVE. This is the first React project code that I am sharing on my GitHub.
> jpg pictures are NOT uploaded here, so if you want to download and start the project it would not work
> ❓ What have I been using?
> ❗ Styling:  CSS, module.css, JSS (js in css to apply styles on some MUI components), sx prop for MUI inline styling
> ❗ Custom card elements (props.children), props, useState, useEffect, React Router, React hooks form, and YUP
> ❗ Third-party libraries like: Axios, Moment, React-pdf, Fslightbox-react, Material UI
> My idea is to rework the pomorie-info vanilla JS project into React JS-made project.
> I hope there will be time for this and the project will be ready before the end of the summer season 2023.

✔🎯 wish me luck! :)
