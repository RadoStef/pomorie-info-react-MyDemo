## Pomorie-info **React** version

<ul>
  <li>❓ What have I been using?</li>
  <li>❗ Styling:  CSS, module.css, JSS (js in css to apply styles on some MUI components), sx prop for MUI inline styling</li>
  <li>❗ Custom card elements (props.children), props, useState, useEffect, React Router, React hooks form, and YUP</li>
  <li>❗ Third-party libraries like: Axios, Moment, React-pdf, Fslightbox-react, Material UI</li>
</ul>
My idea is to rework the pomorie-info vanilla JS project into React project, and also show some of my developink skills and knowledge.
I hope there will be time for this and the project will be ready before the end of the summer season 2023.

✔🎯 wish me luck! :)
